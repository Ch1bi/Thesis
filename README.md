# Thesis Code Challenge

This was a code challenge I received in which I was tasked with creating a landing page as close as possible to the given design.

## Installation

Open the folder, and open the index.html file with your web browser of choice.


## Extra Credit

I noticed that in the mockup the hamburger icon and the links both were showing. I decided to hide the links under the hamburger menu on mobile, and hide the hamburger menu and show the links on desktop. The reason being is that this is a regular pattern on the web / mobile apps.
